# Unofficial-AWS-Samples

This code in the repro is as is. It is not officially supported by Amazon Web Services nor is Amazon Web Services libel for any misuse of the code. While the event it could cause an issue is unlikely. It should be thoroughly tested and reviewed prior to running in a production environment.

This repo is not tied to nor associated with Amazon or Amazon Web Services. This is my personal repo.
